It allows two parties to generate a shared secret key used for encryption, without transmitting the key itself. A potential vulnerability is susceptibility to man-in-the-middle attacks if the identities of the parties are not authenticated, as an attacker could intercept and modify the key exchange to establish separate keys with each party.",

VTP has three modes: Server (creates and manages VLANs), Client (receives VLAN information), and Transparent (does not participate in VTP, forwards VTP advertisements). Risks include accidental overwriting of VLAN configurations if a switch with higher revision number but incorrect VLAN data is introduced, leading to network disruptions.",

It uses port-based access control and works by requiring devices to authenticate themselves before gaining network access. It integrates with RADIUS servers by acting as the authentication mechanism, where the 802.1X authenticator (switch or access point) forwards authentication requests to the RADIUS server for validation.",

    "question": "Describe how MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) improves network efficiency, and explain the difference between label switching and traditional IP routing.",
    "answer": "MPLS improves network efficiency by using labels to make forwarding decisions, enabling faster packet forwarding and supporting QoS by allowing different types of traffic to be managed differently. Unlike traditional IP routing, which requires each router to perform a routing table lookup, label switching uses fixed-length labels to quickly direct packets through the network along predefined paths, reducing processing overhead.",
